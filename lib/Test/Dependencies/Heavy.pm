=head1 NAME

Test::Dependencies::Heavy - Heavy style for checking for dependencies.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

You shouldn't have to include this module yourself.  Look at the
'style' option of L<Test::Dependencies>.

This module exports exactly one function.

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_modules_used_in_file

Returns an array ref of all the modules that the passed file uses.
This style determines this list by actually compiling the code.  This
could be a dangerous operation if the file does bad things in BEGIN
blocks!
