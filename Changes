0.03    Tue Jul 11 16:17:32 EDT 2006
        Moved to a B::PerlReq backend for determining usage.  We
        also now use the META.yml file to determine what is listed in
        Makefile.PL.  We now differentiate between requires and
        build_requires, and complain if listed requirements are not
        actually used.
